Submission : 
All program source code files and/or test data files which you create must be located in or
beneath your home directory. Your home directory will normally be named /home/team
but this may vary between sites so check with your site coordinator. You may create
subdirectories beneath your home directory.

If your program exits with a non-zero exit code, it will be judged as a Run Time Error.
